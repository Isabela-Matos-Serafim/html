    <h1> Epic- The Musical</h1>

    <p>[Odysseus]
Alright my brothers listen closely Tonight we make the Trojans pay Ten years of war they killed us slowly But now we'll be the ones who slay Think of your wives and your children
Your families wonder where you've been They're growing old and yet you're still here Do what I say and you'll see them again
[Soldiers]
Yes sir!
[Odysseus]
Diomedes will lead the charge
Agamemnon will flank the guards
Menelaus will let our mates through the gates
To take the whole city at large
Teucer will shoot any ambush attack
And Little Ajax will stay back
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
[Soldiers]
Yes sir!
[Odysseus and soldiers]
Find that inner strength now (huh)
Use that well of pride (huh)
Fight though every pain now (huh)
Ask yourself inside
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?
[Soldiers]
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?
[Odysseus]
Penelope
Penelope
And Telemachus
I fight for us, I fight for us
[Soldiers and Odysseus]
What do you live for? (Penelope)
What do you try for? (Telemachus)
What do you wish for? (I'm on my way)
What do you fight for?
[Odysseus]
Attack!
[Odysseus]
Who was that?
[Zeus]
A vision of what is to come
Cannot be outrun
Can only be dealt with right here and now
[Odysseus]
Tell me how
[Zeus]
I don't think you're ready
A mission to kill someone's son
A foe who won't run
Unlike anyone you have faced before
[Odysseus]
Say no more
I know that I'm ready
[Zeus & Ensemble]
I don't think you're ready
[Odysseus]
It's just an infant
It's just a boy
What sort of imminent threat does he pose that I cannot avoid?
[Zeus]
This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector
Know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger
One fueled with rage as you're consumed by age
If you don't end him now you'll have no one left to save
You can say goodbye to
[Ensemble]
Penelope
[Zeus]
You can say goodbye to
[Ensemble]
Penelope
[Odysseus, Zeus & Ensemble]
I could raise him as my own (he will burn your house and throne)
Or send him far away from home (he'll find you wherever you go)
Make sure his past is never known (the gods will make it known)
I'd rather bleed for ya (he's bringing you)
I'm on my knees for ya (down on your knees for ya)
I'm begging, please! (oh, this is the will of the gods)
[Odysseus]
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this!
[Zeus]
The blood on your hands is something you won't lose
[Zeus & Ensemble]
All you can choose is whose
[Odysseus]
I look into your eyes and I
Think back to the son of mine
You're as old as he was
When I left for war
Will these actions haunt my days?
Every man I’ve slain?
Is the price I pay endless pain?
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
How could I hurt you?
I'm just a man
Who's trying to go home
Even after all the years away from what I’ve know
I'm just a man
Who's fighting for his life
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
I'm just a man
But when does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candlе become a blaze?
Whеn does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?
[Soldiers and Odysseus]
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze? (Forgive me)
When does a man become a monster? (Forgive me)
When does a man become a monster? (Forgive me)
[Odysseus]
I'm just a man
[Odysseus and crew]
Six hundred men
Six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
(Make it back alive to our homeland)
Six hundred men
Six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
(It's what lies in between)
And Ithaca's waiting (Ithaca's waiting)
My kingdom is waiting (the kingdom is waiting)
Penelope's waiting for me (waiting)
So full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
[Eurylochus and crew]
Captain (Eurylochus)
Six hundred men (six hundred men)
Six hundred men with big mouths to feed
And we've run out of supplies to eat
(Curse the war, our food store's depleted)

Six hundred men (six hundred men)
Six hundred reasons to take what we can
So captain, what's the plan?
(Captain, what's the plan?)

[Odysseus and crew]
Watch where the birds fly
(Watch where the birds fly)
They will lead us to land
(They will lead us to land)
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command (second in command)
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead

[Eurylochus]
We're up, we're off, and away we go

[Crew]
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go

[Polites]
Captain

[Odysseus]
Polites!

[Polites]
Look!
There in the distance, I see an island
I see a light that faintly glows
Maybe they're people lighting a fire
Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?

[Odysseus]
Something feels off here
I see fire but there's no smoke

[Eurylochus]
I say we strike first, we don't have time to waste
So let's raid the place and

[Odysseus and polites]
No
Polites gear up
You and I'll go ahead (you and I'll go ahead)
We should try to find a way no one ends up dead

[Eurylochus]
We don't know what's ahead

[Odysseus]
Give me till sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus and crew]
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go

[Odysseus]
Full speed ahead

[Crew]
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and a
Full speed ahead
[Polites]
You can relax, my friend

[Odysseus]
Huh?

[Polites]
I can tell you're getting nervous
So do yourself a service
And try to relax my friend

[Odysseus]
I'm fine, Polites

[Polites]
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into

I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You could show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
Give it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[Lotus eaters]
Welcome

[Odysseus]
Stay back

[Lotus eaters]
Stay back

[Polites]
My friend, greet the world with open arms

[Odysseus]
We're only here for food

[Lotus eaters]
Food

[Odysseus]
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces

[Lotus eaters]
Food

[Odysseus]
Stay back, I'm warning you

[Lotus eaters]
Food

[Odysseus]
If we don't get back safely, my men will turn this place into blazes

[Lotus eaters]
Here you go

[Polites]
See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[Odysseus]
My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms

[Polites]
Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?

[Lotus eaters]
The cave, scary cave

[Polites]
A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?

[Lotus eaters]
East, that way

[Polites]
Thank you!

[Lotus eaters]
Welcome

[Polites]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[Odysseus]
Greet the world with open arms

[Polites]
You can relax, my friend

[Athena]
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?

[Odysseus]
Athena!

[Athena]
Have you forgotten to turn off your heart?
This is not you

I see you changing from how I've designed you
Have you forgotten your purpose?
Let me remind you

Goddess of wisdom
Master of war
My life has one mission
Create the greatest warrior

I had a challenge, a test of skill
A magic boar only the best could kill
One day a boy came for the thrill
A boy whose mind rivalled the boar's own will

[Odysseus]
Let's go!

[Athena]
Maybe one day he'll follow me
And we'll make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
I know he'll change the world
'Cause he is a warrior of the mind

Maybe one day I'll reach him
And we can build his skills as I teach him
If there's a problem, he'll have the answer
He is a warrior of the mind

[Odysseus]
Show yourself
I know you're watching me
Show yourself

I can see you

[Athena]
How can you see through my spell?

[Odysseus]
Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff
Aha, haha!

[Athena]
Well done, enlighten me
What's your name?

[Odysseus]
You first, and maybe I'll do the same

[Athena]
Nice try, but two can play this game

[Odysseus]
Nah! Don't be modest
I know you're a goddess
So let's be honest
You are Athena

[Ensamble]
Athena!

[Odysseus and ensamble]
Badass in the arena (arena)
Unmatched, witty and queen of (and queen of)
The best strategies we've seen

[Athena]
If you're looking for a mentor
I'll make sure your time's well spent

[Odysseus]
Sounds like a plan
Goddess and man
Bestest of friends

[Athena]
We'll see where it ends

[Odysseus]
Okay

[Athena]
Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll

[Athena and Odysseus]
Make a greater tomorrow
Then they'll see
I know we'll change the world cause
We are the Warriors of the Mind

Maybe one day we'll reach them
And we can build their skills as we teach them
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
We are the Warriors of the Mind

[Athena]
I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind
Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind
You are a Warrior of the Mind
Don't disappoint me 
[Odysseus]
Over here!

[Polites]
Look at all this food, look at all these sheep
I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep

[Eurylochus]
I've gotta hand it to you both, this is quite the treat
There are enough sheep here to feed the entire fleet

[Odysseus]
It's almost too perfect, too good to be true
Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?

[Polyphemus]
Who are you?

[Odysseus]
Hey there
We're just travellers
We come in peace

[Polyphemus]
You killed my sheep
My favouritе sheep
What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep
Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you rеap?

Time to drink
Your blood over where you stand
Your life now is in my hand
Before I'm done
You will learn that it's not so fun to take
You came to my home to steal
But now you'll become my meal
A trade, you see?
Take from you like you took from me

[Odysseus]
There's been a misunderstanding
We never came here to steal
But now that I see we've done some damage
Maybe you and I could make a deal
I'll give you our finest treasure
So long as we leave alive
You can keep the world's best tasting wine

[Polyphemus]
Wine?

[Odysseus]
Have a drink
One sip and you'll understand
The power that's in your hands
A wine so fresh
You'd never wanna eat human flesh again
Then we shall be on our way
No bloodshed in here today
A trade, you see?
A gift from you and a gift from me

[Polyphemus]
Ah, I'd like to thank you
Stranger, what's your name?

[Odysseus]
My name is nobody, nobody, nobody

[Polyphemus]
Nobody, for your gift I've one to reply

[Odysseus]
I'm so glad we see eye to eye

[Polyphemus]
Yes, you shall be the final man to die

[Odysseus]
What?
Watch out!

[Odysseus]
My brothers
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
And if we're defeated, they’re good as dead
Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting

No backup, no chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
No dying on me now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

[Odysseus and crew]
Surround him (surround him)
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels (strike the heels)
Show him that we're deadly

Exhaust him (exhaust him)
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives

Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
(Push forward)
No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

[Polites]
Captain

[Polyphemus]
Enough

[Crew]
He’s got a club
He's got a club!
What are our orders?
Captain? Captain!

[Polyphemus]
You’ve hurt me enough
Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed
You won’t live through this day now die
Die
[Eurylochus]
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!

[Odysseus]
We must move quickly, we don't have much time
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Mark my words now, this is not the end

[Eurylochus]
But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?

[Odysseus]
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain

Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain

I need all our hands on his club
This is how we're getting out of here
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
And turn it to a giant spear

[Crew]
Let's kill him!

[Odysseus]
His body is blocking the path
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside

[Eurylochus]
Captain, where do we attack him?

[Odysseus]
We gotta stab him in the eye

[Crew]
Yes sir

Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain

[Odysseus and crew]
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain

[Odysseus]
Now!
Scatter!

[Cyclopes]
Who hurts you?

[Eurylochus]
There are more of them?

[Cyclopes]
Who hurts you?

[Odysseus, whispering]
Hide!

[Cyclopes]
Who hurts you?

[Eurylochus]
Captain, we should run

[Odysseus]
Wait!

[Cyclopes]
Who hurts you?

[Eurylochus]
Captain, please!

[Odysseus]
Wait!

[Polyphemus]
It was Nobody, Nobody

[Cyclopes]
If nobody hurts you, be silent

[Polyphemus]
Don’t go!

[Odysseus]
Let's grab the sheep and away we go

[Athena]
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
He's still a threat until he's dead
Finish it

[Odysseus]
No

[Athena]
No?

[Odysseus]
What good would killing do
When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use
My friend is dead, our foe is blind
The blood we shed, it never dries
Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?

[Athena]
Don't!

[Odysseus]
Hey, Cyclops!
When we met, I led with peace
While you fed your inner beast
But my comrades will not die in vain

Remember them
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
Remember them
Remember us
Remember me

I'm the reigning king of Ithaca
I am neither man nor mythical
I am your darkest moment
I am the infamous
Odysseus
[Athena]
You were reckless, sentimental at best
That's not a teaching of mine
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest

[Odysseus]
Hey!

[Athena]
Put your emotions aside
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
I don't know where I went wrong
But I warned you, and you failed the test
So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
This way, you won't disappoint me
This way, you won't waste my time
This way, I'll close the door
Consider this as my goodbye

[Odysseus]
That’s just like you, why should I be surprised?
Selfish and prideful and vain
Unlike you, every time someone dies
I'm left to deal with the strain
What's a title that a goddess could lend if I’ll never sleep at night?
I'll remind you I saw you as a friend
But now we're done

This way, you're out of my head now
This way, you won’t plague my life
This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind
This way, you get what you wanted
This way, you can save your time
This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye

[Athena]
You're not looking for a mentor
I'm not looking for a friend
I mistook you for a general
What a waste of effort spent

[Odysseus]
At least I know what I'm fighting for
While you're fighting to be known
Since you claim you're so much wiser
Why's your life spent all alone?
You're alone

[Athena]
One day, you'll hear what I'm saying
One day, you might understand
One day, but not today, for after all you're

[Ensemble]
Just a man

[Athena and Ensemble]
This day, you sever your own head
This day, you cut the line
This day, you lost it all
Consider this as my goodbye
Oh
Consider this as my goodbye
Oh
This is my goodbye
Oh
Consider this as my goodbye
Oh
This is my goodbye

[Odysseus]
These waves and tides
Have grown in strength and size
Is it nature or divine
Or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight
This storm's our final fight
There's no time to die
Comrades

[Crew]
Sir!

[Odysseus and crew]
Brace for a storm, oh-oh-oh
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm, oh-oh-oh
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
(Full speed ahead)

[Odysseus]
Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be saved

[Eurylochus]
Captain, we will capsize with these waves, our fleet will fail

[Odysseus and crew]
Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail
Storm, oh-oh-oh
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)

[Eurylochus]
We're taking too much damage to survive

[Odysseus and crew]
We'll beat this storm, oh-oh-oh
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)

[Eurylochus]
At this rate, we won't make it out alive

[Perimedes and Elpenor]
Captain, look!

[Odysseus and Eurylochus]
An island in the sky

[Odysseus]
Eurylochus, grab the harpoons
As many as you can find

[Eurylochus]
What do you have in mind?

[Odysseus]
We're gonna shoot for the sky

[Eurylochus]
What?

[Crew]
Storm, oh-oh-oh
Storm, oh-oh-oh

[Odysseus and crew]
Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)
(Storm, oh-oh-oh)
We're shooting for the island in the sky
In the sky

[Eurylochus]
Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

[Odysseus]
You've heard the legends of the island in the sky, this proves they're true
We're in the home of the wind God

[Eurylochus]
We don't know for sure

[Odysseus]
How many floating islands have you seen before?
This is the home of the wind God

[Eurylochus]
And what's your plan?

[Odysseus]
I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand

[Eurylochus]
You could be caught off guard and lose your life
Or piss off this God and infuse us with strife
Don't forget how dangerous the gods are

[Odysseus]
Have faith, friend, we've come this far

[Eurylochus]
Yes, but how much longer till your luck runs out?
How much longer till the show goes south?
How much longer till we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah

[Odysseus]
I still believe in goodness
I still believe that we could be kind
Lead from the heart, and see what starts

[Eurylochus]
And what will we do when it tears us apart?

[Odysseus]
Where is this coming from, my friend?

[Eurylochus]
I just don't wanna see another life end
You're like the brother I could never do without

[Odysseus]
Yet suddenly you doubt that I could figure this out?

[Eurylochus]
Captain, how much longer till your luck runs out?
How much longer till the show goes south?
How much longer till we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
How much longer till the snake breaks free?
How much longer till your great days cease?
How much longer till your strength takes leave?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah

[Odysseus]
Thank you for the concern but brother I can assure you
Our journey is almost done
I understand that we're tired
I understand that we're fazed
But don't forget how much we've already faced
I took 600 men to war and not one of them died there
In case you needed a reminder
If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then

I need to talk to you in private
I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
I can't have you disagreeing each route
I need you to always be devout and comply with this
Or we'll all die in this

Okay?

[Eurylochus]
Okay

[Odysseus]
Thank you
Keep Your Friends Close
Jorge Rivera-Herrans

[Odysseus]
Great wind God, Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect winds for us and aid our journey home?

[Aeolus]
Ha ha ha
I am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game

[Odysseus]
A game?

[Aeolus]
That's what I'm serving
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning

[Odysseus]
Deal

[Aeolus]
Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag

[Odysseus]
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

[Aeolus, winions]
Ha ha ha
Keep your friends close and your enemiеs closer
Never rеally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say: No, sir
Sometimes killing is a must

[Odysseus]
What?

[Aeolus and winions]
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Friends turn into foes and rivalries
So keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust (never really know who you can trust)

[Perimedes]
Captain, what's happening?

[Perimedes and Elpenor]
What's trapped in that bag?

[Odysseus]
Something dangerous, friends
We mustn't lag

[Winions]
It's treasure!

[Odysseus]
What?

[Winions]
Buh-bye!

[Perimedes]
Open the bag

[Elpenor]
Let's see what you got

[Odysseus]
No, do not
Everybody listen closely
See how this bag is closed?
That's how it's supposed to be
This bag has the storm inside
We cannot let the treasure rumor fly

[Perimedes and Elpenor]
We'll try

[Aeolus, crew and winions]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Now they wanna get the bag open so they can have closure
Sometimes sneaking is a must
Sometimes sneaking is a must
'Cause the end always justifies the means
Everything's changed since polites, so
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust

[Odysseus]
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Trying to make it home with no storm or tidal wave
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
And I'm getting closer to you

[Crew]
Penelope

[Odysseus]
I can't wait to make some new memories

[Crew]
Telemachus

[Odysseus]
Time for me to be the father I never was

[Penelope and Telemachus]
Just keep your eyes open

[Odysseus]
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy?

[Penelope and Telemachus]
Just keep your eyes open

[Odysseus]
I keep on trying to embrace you both
Why won't you let me?

[Penelope and Telemachus]
Just keep your eyes open

[Odysseus]
So much has changed but I'm the same
Yes I'm the same

[Penelope and Telemachus]
Just keep your eyes open

[Ensemble]
Keep your eyes open

[Penelope]
Wake up!
Wake up, odysseus, they're opening the bag
Wake up!

[Odysseus]
No!

[Aeolus, crew and winions]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Storm
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus]
Where's the storm taking us?

[Aeolus]
I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant
If I had to guess? You're heading to the

[Aeolus and winions]
Land of the giants

[Crew]
Storm, storm

[Odysseus]
Help me close the bag

[Eurylochus]
But sir, it's too late

[Odysseus]
We can save whatever wind is left to use another day
Come on!

[Poseidon]
Odysseus of ithaca
Do you know who I am?
Ruthlessness
Jorge Rivera-Herrans

[Laestrygonians]
Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon

[Odysseus]
Poseidon

[Poseidon]
In all my years of living
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I try to chill with the waves
But damn, you crossed the line

I've been so gracious
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine

[Odysseus]
No

[Poseidon]
I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown
But before you go, I need to make you learn how

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
(Ruthlеssness is mercy upon ourselvеs)
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

You are the worst kind of good
'Cause you're not even great
A greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate

Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son
But no

You are far too nice
Mercy has a price
It's the final crack we're about to break the ice now

You reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
(Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves)
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

And now it is finally time
To say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain
And all his cries

[Odysseus]
Poseidon, we meant no harm
We only hurt him to disarm him
We took no pleasure in his pain
We only wanted to escape

[Poseidon]
The line between naïveté and
Hopefulness is almost invisible
So close your heart
The world is dark and

[Laestrygonians]
Ruthlessness is mercy

[Poseidon]
Die

[Laestrygonians and soldiers]
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our-
(Captain, Captain)
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our-
(Captain, Captain)
Ruthlessness is mercy upon our-
(Captain, Captain)
Ruthlessness is

[Odysseus]
What have you done?

[Soldiers]
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?

[Poseidon]
Forty-three left under your command

[Soldiers]
When does man become a monster?

[Poseidon]
I am your darkest moment
The monster that always draws near
Any last words?

[Odysseus]
All I gotta do is open this bag

[Poseidon]
What?

Remember me
Puppeteer
Jorge Rivera-Herrans

[Eurylochus]
Captain, I have something that I must confess
Something that I must get off my chest
Until it is said, I cannot rest
Captain?

[Odysseus]
Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure

[Eurylochus]
But captain

[Odysseus]
There's only so much left we can endure
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
Of that, I'm sure

[Eurylochus]
Okay

[Odysseus]
Eurylochus, back so soon?
Where's the rest of your crew?
And by the gods, what happened to you?

[Eurylochus]
We came across a palace
Inside we heard a voice
It seemed to show no malice
To greet it was our choice
But nothing could prepare us for the power that awaited inside

[Odysseus]
What did this palace hide?

[Eurylochus]
Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist
But this was a hell of a twist, 'cause we are weak to a power like this

[Odysseus]
What was it?

[Eurylochus]
A woman

[Odysseus]
What?

[Eurylochus]
She had us in just two words

[Circe]
Come inside

[Odysseus]
Damn

[Circe]
Welcome to the best part of your lives
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
I've got you, don't worry Circe's got you now

[Eurylochus]
Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in

[Circe]
Take a seat
Let me bring you all something to eat
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet
I've got you, don't worry Circe's got you now

[Eurylochus]
By the time they ate, it was far too late

[Eurylochus and Circe]
For inside the meal (think of your past)
She had cast a spell (and your mistakes)
They began to squeal (they'll be the last)
And grow snouts and tails (mistakes you'll make)
She changed them

[Circe]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[Eurylochus and Circe]
They transformed (this is the price)
And it wasn't quick (we pay to live)
She turned our men (the world does not)
From men to pigs (tend to forgive)
She changed them

[Circe]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[Odysseus]
We have to go save them

[Eurylochus]
No we don't
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned
Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned
Think about the men we have left before there are none
Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run

[Odysseus]
Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
I can only hope you'd do the same

[Eurylochus and Circe]
I can hear her still, (no one will find)
And her voice deceives, (their way between)
What if she can’t be killed? (my nymphs and I)
Will you choose to leave? (their loving queen)

[Odysseus]
I don’t know

[Circe]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[Eurylochus, circe]
She’s a clever witch, (this is the price)
And she’s hard to slay (we pay to love)
It’s a game of wits (we draw the line)
But you don’t have to play (watch from above)

[Odysseus]
I have to try

[Circe]
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

[Hermes]
I must say what a brilliant speech you gave

[Odysseus]
Who goes there?

[Hermes]
Just a friend who could help you save your men
A foe like circe is not to be messed with
You want to beat her?
You'll need the blessing of a certain God
Divine intervention
Someone who's not afraid to send a message

[Odysseus]
Hermes?

[Hermes]
Hahahahaha

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

She can turn you into an animal that'll end up on her plate
She can all but make you fall in love like you're on your hundredth date
She can conjure up a monster that'll grind you to the bones
She has all the ways to haunt ya when you take her on alone

[Hermes and ensemble]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Oh

[Hermes]
Here in the root of this flower
There lies such a power to take her on
You must consume and digest it
Then you’ll manifest a being of your creation
All you need’s imagination
Though it’s only for a moment
Till you’ve beaten your opponent
And I call this root: Holy moly

[Odysseus]
Ah

[Hermes]
Hahahahahaha!

[Hermes and ensemble]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

[Hermes, ensemble and odysseus]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power? (Oh)
Wouldn't you like to use more than words? (Oh)
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours (oh)
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic? (Oh)
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred? (Oh)
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic (oh)
I'll help you conquer her

[Odysseus]
Hermes
Thank you

[Hermes]
Don’t thank me friend
You very well may die
Haha, good luck
[Odysseus]
Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this
But I hope that I've been misinformed
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through
Here and they wound up at your door
Through the years we seldom
Get a warm welcome, so
I must ask just to be sure
Did you do something to them?

[Circe]
Who, me?
All I did was reveal their true forms

[Odysseus]
You turned them into pigs

[Circe]
Huh
I don't know who you are nor why you're here
But let me make this one thing clear
I've got people to protect
Nymphs I can't nеglect
So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you makе one wrong move, then you're done for
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for
I could put a spell on you and you're done for
Boy, you better run or soon you will done for

[Odysseus]
I don't mean to tip your scale but
You will fail at
Placing any spells on me
I just ate a flower
One that claims your power
So you better cower now and flee

[Circe]
You must be a liar
Mortals can't acquire
Moly without dire consequence

[Odysseus]
Then I must be a God like you
Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands

[Circe]
Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?

[Odysseus]
Okay, fine, yes, but regardless
You and I are now evenly matched
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached

[Odysseus & circe]
I've got people to protect, friends I can't neglect
So now there is no turning back
You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Not even a spell saves you, cause you're done for
Oh, you better run or soon you will be done for

[Odysseus]
You've lost

[Circe]
My nymphs are like my daughters
I protect them at all costs
The last time we let strangers live
We faced a heavy loss
You've given me no reason to
Bestow you with my trust
But everyone's true colours are
Revealed in acts of lust

[Odysseus]
I'm not sure I follow

[CIRCE]
There are other ways of persuasion
There are other modes of control
There are other means of deceit
There are other roads to the soul
There are other actions of passion
You have so much left to learn
Want to save your men from the fire?
Show me that you're willing to burn, woah

[ODYSSEUS & CIRCE]
Who's to say, with the mistakes I've made (don't be afraid)
That they will be thе last (think of your past)
Mistakes I ever makе?
(Don't break when)
There is so much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here

This is the price we pay to love (I'm just a man)
There is no line, never enough (I'm just a man)
So much power, so much power (forgive me)
But there's no puppet here

[ODYSSEUS]
I can’t!
Back at home, my wife awaits for me
She is my everything, my Penelope
And she’s all my power, all my power
But it’s been twelve long years, oh
Twelve long years since I have seen my wife
And now the God of Tides is out to end my life
So I beg you Circe, grant us mercy
And let us puppets leave

[CIRCE]
Poseidon, eh?
There might be a way to evade him
There might be a way to get home
Though this other way’s very dangerous
It might be your one final hope
I know of a brilliant prophet
Problem is this prophet is dead
I can’t get you home, but I’ll get you to the Underworld instead
I’ll release your men, and I’ll get you to the Underworld instead

[ODYSSEUS]
Wait, you’re helping us?

[CIRCE]
There are many ways of persuasion
There are many modes of control
Maybe showing one act of kindness
Leads to kinder souls down the road
I remember actions of passion
I have been in love once before
Maybe one day the world will need a puppeteer no more
Or maybe one day the world will need a puppeteer more!

[SOLDIERS]
So much power, so much power
But there’s no puppet here
No she’s not a player, she’s a puppeteer
No she’s not a player, she’s a puppeteer
Yeah

[Odysseus]
Friends, circe's instructions were clear
No matter what we hear

[Crew]
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus]
Until we find the prophet
My comrades, this land confuses your mind
So no matter who we find

[All]
Full speed ahead
Until we find the prophet

[Odysseus]
Good

[Odysseus and soldiers]
All I hear are screams
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
(Nothing's what it seems)
And here in the underworld
The past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind

[Fallen soldiers]
When does a man become a monster?
558 men who died under your command
Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!
Why would you let the cyclops live
When ruthlessness is mercy?

[Odysseus and soldiers]
All I hear are screams
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
(Nothing's what it seems)
But in the underworld
The past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night

[Polites]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

[Odysseus]
Polites

[Polites]
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

[Odysseus]
Polites

[Anticlea]
Waiting

[Odysseus]
That voice, it can't be

[Anticlea and Odysseus]
Waiting (mom?)
Odysseus, when you come home I'll be waiting
Even if you're the last thing I see, I'll be waiting
I'm right here, mom
(Waiting)
Can't you see? I'm
(Waiting)

[Both]
Waiting

[Odysseus and Anticlea]
I took too long
(I'll always love you)
And ventured too far
(I'll stay in your heart)
While you were

[Both]
Waiting, waiting, waiting

[Odyssues]
Bye mom

[Odysseus and soldiers]
All I hear are screams
(All I hear are screams)
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream
(I no longer dream)
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
(Nothing's what it seems)
But in the underworld, your past is always close behind
Your past is always close behind
Down in the underworld
[Tiresias]
I am the prophet with the answers you seek
Time, I've unlocked it
I see past and future running free
There is a world where I help you get home
But that's not a world I know

[Odysseus]
What?

[Tiresias]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of men
I see portrayals of betrayals
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you

[Odysseus]
This can't be
We've suffered and sailed through the toughest of hells
Now you tell us our effort's for nothing?

[Tiresias]
I see your palace covered in red
Faces of men who had long believed you're dead
I see your wife with a man who is haunting
A man with a trail of bodies

[Odysseus]
Who?

[Tiresias]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of men
I see portrayals of betrayals
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death (siren song, scylla throat)
I see you draw your final breath (mutiny, lightning bolt)
I see a man who gets to make it home alive (hurt Poseidon, kill all the suitors for love)
But it's no longer you

[All]
O-dy-sse-us!
O-dy-sse-us!

[Odysseus]
How has everything been turned against us?
How did suffering become so endless?
How am I to reunite with my estranged?
Do I need to change?

I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost
I'm the only one whose line I haven't crossed
What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea
Is me?

What if I'm the monster?
What if I'm in the wrong?
What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?
What if I'm the one who killed you
Every time I caved to guilt?
What if I've been far too kind to foes
But a monster to ourselves?
What if I'm the monster

Is the Cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?
Is he up in the middle of the night?
Or does he end my men to avenge his friend
And then sleep knowing he has done him right?

When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
Is she going insane?
Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
When a God comes down and makes a fleet drown
Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?
Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him
And now no one dares to piss him off?
Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping trojans cause he is vile?
Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile

If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away
Would that make us stronger?
Would it keep our foes at bay?
If I became the monster to everyone but us
And made sure we got home again
Who would care if we're unjust?
If I became the

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
And deep down I know this well
I lost my best friend
I lost my mentor, my mom
500 men gone, this can't go on
I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus
So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches
I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us
And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall
In an instant so we all don't die

[Odysseus and all]
Then I'll become the
Monster
I will deal the blow
And I'll become the
Monster
Like none they've ever known
So what if I'm the
Monster
Lurking deep below?

I must become the

[Soldiers]
Monster

And then we'll make it home

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
Penelope

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
Telemachus

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

[Soldiers]
Monster

[Odysseus]
I'll become the monster

[Ensemble]
Penelope
Penelope

[Penelope]
Don't you miss me?

[Odysseus]
More than you know

[Penelope]
Then jump in the water and kiss me

[Odysseus]
Penelope, I've told you this before
You know I'm afraid of the water

[Penelope]
I'll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let's watch our love leave the ground

[Odysseus]
Oh, I would
But I'd be suffering trying to float the whole time

[Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I'm just finе

[Penelope]
I can take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You know that I prеfer my feet on the ground

[Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

[Penelope]
Of course!

[Odysseus]
Okay, so let's say I was on the run or hiding
From I don't know Poseidon
And let's say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

[Penelope]
Oh no!

[Odysseus]
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

[Penelope]
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he'd never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It's through the lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
No

[Penelope]
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
But Scylla has a cost

[Penelope]
Well, you asked and now you know
Now jump in the water!

[Odysseus]
Penelope, why?
You know I'm too shy and terrified

[Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, for you I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

[Penelope]
I can take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time

[Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Ah, the things I do for you

[Odysseus]
Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine
You've been tryna take my life this whole time
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Yeah, I know exactly what you are: A Siren
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched

[Siren]
What?

[Odysseus & Soldiers]
We are a different beast now
We arе the ones who feast now
No morе of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[Odysseus]
We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
First we slayed in our own war
And now, we're here with more foes
While on the run from Poseidon
We found a ship with no crew
I realised nearby, there were sirens
Singing sailors to their dooms
We filled our ears with beeswax
That's how we resist your song
You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along
I read your lips and phrases
Scanning for information
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Now I know how to get back to my island

[Soldiers]
We are a different beast now
We are the ones who feast now
No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[Sirens]
Spare us
Oh, spare us please

[Odysseus]
Why?
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
Throw their bodies back in the water
Let them drown

[Sirens]
No!

[Soldiers]
He is a different beast now
He is the one who feasts now
No more of us deceased, 'cause he won't take more suffering from you
He is the man-made monster
He is the one who conquers
You are a threat no longer
He won't take more suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Kill them all!

[Soldiers]
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[Odysseus]
Kill them all!

[Soldiers]
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[Odysseus]
Kill them all!

[Soldiers]
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

[Odysseus]
Kill 'em all!

[Soldiers]
Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh
Odysseus
[Odysseus]
The lair of Scylla
This is our only way home

[Scylla]
Deep down

[Eurylochus]
You're quiet today

[Scylla]
Deep down

[Odysseus]
Not much to say

[All]
Deep down

[Scylla]
You hide a reason for shame

[Eurylochus]
I've got a secret I can no longer keep

[Soldiers]
Deep down

[Scylla]
You know that we are the same

[Eurylochus]
I opened the wind bag while you were asleep

[Scylla]
Leaving them feeling betrayed
Breaking the bonds that you've made

[Eurylochus]
I'm so sorry

[Scylla]
There is no price we won't pay

[Eurylochus]
Forgive me

[Scylla]
We both know what it takes to survive

[Soldiers]
Full speed ahead, full speed, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

[All]
Deep down

[Scylla]
We only carе for ourselves

[Odysseus]
Eurylochus, light up six torches

[Scylla]
Deep down, wе're lonely demons from hell

[Eurylochus]
Captain, something approaches

[Scylla]
Hello

[Odysseus]
Row for your lives!

[Scylla]
Drown in your sorrow and fears
Choke on your blood and your tears
Bleed til you've run out of years
We must do what it takes to survive

Give up your honor and faith
Live up your life as a wraith
Die in the blood where you bathe
We must do what it takes to survive

[Scylla and Odysseus]
We are the same, you and I, I
Mutiny
Jorge Rivera-Herrans

[Eurylochus]
Tell me you did not know that would happen
Say you didn't know how that would end
Look me in the eyes and tell me, Captain
That you did not just sacrifice six men?
Use your wits to try and say I'm crazy and mad
That this is all some trick the gods have sent
Tell me you did not miss home so painfully bad
That you gave up the lives of six of our friends?

When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan
And when we fought with Circe, it was you who left behind no man
But when we saw this monster, we didn't take a stand
We just ran
Say something

[Odysseus]
I can't

[Eurylochus]
Then you havе forced my hand

[Soldiers]
Eurylochus

[Odysseus]
Lower your weapon

[Eurylochus]
No can do
You miss your wifе so bad, you trade the lives of your own crew

[Odysseus]
Don't make me fight you, brother, you know you'd have done the same

[Eurylochus]
If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame!

[Soldiers]
Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
There is no price he won't pay

[Odysseus]
I am not letting you get in my way
My brothers, why?

[Perimedes & soldiers]
How are we supposed to trust you now?
Now your time has come, your luck's run out
Now, the time has come to shut you down
You relied on wit and then we died on it
Woah-oh-oh

[Odysseus]
Agh, my head
Where are we?

[Eurylochus]
Some island, the first one we found
It's bursting with cows just roaming around
Begging us to eat, so much meat
And hunger is so heavy

This statue
The God of the Sun
Don't know where it's from
But here's where we found all these cows to hunt
Right in front
And hunger is so heavy

[Soldiers]
Hunger is so heavy

[Odysseus]
Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

[Eurylochus]
Ody, we're never gonna get to make it home
You know it's true

[Odysseus]
You don't know that's true
This is the home of the Sun God

[Eurylochus]
I'm starving, my friend

[Odysseus]
But if you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send?
This is the home of the Sun God

[Eurylochus]
I'm tired, my friend

[Odysseus]
But we're so close to home, this can't be where it ends

[Eurylochus, Odysseus]
How much longer must I suffer now?
(Please don't do this)
How much longer must I push through doubt?
(I need to get home)
How much longer must I go about
(Eurylochus)
My life like this, when people die like this?
Woah-oh-oh

[Eurylochus & soldiers, Odysseus]
How much longer must we suffer now?
(Reconsider)
How much longer must we push through doubt?
(We can get home)
How much longer must we go about
(Eurylochus)
Our lives like this when people die like this?
Woah

[Eurylochus]
I'm just a man

[Odysseus]
Eurylochus no!

You've doomed us
You've doomed us all, Eurylochus!

[Eurylochus]
Captain?

[Odysseus]
We need to get away from this island now!
Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow
These cows were immortal, they were the Sun God's friends
And now that we've pissed them off, who do you think he'll send?

[Soldiers]
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus]
Faster!

[Soldiers]
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus]
Faster!

[Soldiers]
Full speed ahead

[Odysseus]
We're too late
Thunder Bringer (feat. Luke Holt, Anna Casey & Armando Julián)
Jorge Rivera-Herrans

[Zeus]
Pride is a damsel in distress
Hiding away where only I can undress her
Try all she can not to confess
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure

Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed

Tell me, Odysseus, If I were to make you choose
The lives of your men and crew or your own
Why do I think they'd lose?
Enlighten me, King of Ithaca
Since hunger was far too great
I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned
And suffer a gruesome fate to the

Thunder bringer, here to ring your
Ears until you're deaf with fear and
Spear you while your death is near
Lightning wielder, here to yield your
Time for you have passed your prime
Sublime you for your act of crime

[Zeus]
Choose

[Odysseus]
Choose?

[Zeus]
Someone's got to die today
And you have got the final say
You?
Or your crew?

[Odysseus]
Please don't make me do this
Don't make me do this

[Soldiers, Penelope]
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze? (I can take the suffering from you)
When does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame? (Let me take the suffering from)
When does a man become a monster?

[Eurylochus]
Captain?

[Odysseus]
I have to see her

[Eurylochus]
But we'll die

[Odysseus]
I know

[Zeus]
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed
